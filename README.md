# H1N1-Flu-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build predictive models to estimate the 
probability of individuals receiving the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal 
f
 lu vaccine based on demographic, behavioral, and health-related 
factors. The dataset used for this analysis comes from the 2009 
National H1N1 Flu Survey, which includes responses from thousands of 
individuals regarding their attitudes towards vaccination, medical 
history, and risk perception. 
Understanding vaccine uptake patterns is crucial for public health 
authorities to design targeted awareness campaigns and vaccination 
programs, especially during pandemic situations. By leveraging 
machine learning models, we aim to improve vaccine adoption 
strategies. 
The models developed include: 
✅
 Logistic Regression – A simple baseline model. 
✅
 Random Forest – A tree-based model capturing non-linear 
relationships. 
✅
 XGBoost – An advanced boosting algorithm. 
✅
 LightGBM – A fast gradient boosting model that performed the best. 
This report presents an exploratory data visualization, data 
preprocessing steps, and a comparison of model performances using 
ROC-AUC scores
